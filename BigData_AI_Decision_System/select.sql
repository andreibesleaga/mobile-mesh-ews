 -- =========================================
 -- SETUP REQUIREMENTS FOR ML.GENERATE_TEXT_LLM
 -- =========================================
 -- To use these examples, you need to:
 --
 -- 1. Enable Vertex AI API in your Google Cloud project
 -- 2. Create a Vertex AI connection in BigQuery:
 --    CREATE OR REPLACE EXTERNAL CONNECTION `your-project.your-location.gemini`
 --    OPTIONS (type = 'CLOUD_RESOURCE', cloud_resource = 'projects/your-project/locations/us-central1')
 --
 -- 3. Grant necessary IAM permissions:
 --    - roles/aiplatform.user
 --    - roles/bigquery.connectionUser
 --
 -- 4. Replace 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID' with your actual project ID
 -- 5. Ensure you have access to Gemini Pro model
 -- 6. Monitor usage costs - AI model calls incur charges
