# BigData AI E2E Decision System

## Overview

This is an end-to-end AI-powered Early Warning System (EWS) Big Data Decision System and Routing Layer, built on Google BigQuery that processes real-time sensor data and satellite imagery to generate intelligent climate risk alerts. The system combines sensor telemetry, satellite image analysis, and AI models to provide automated decision-making for wildfire and flood risk assessment.

This project uses new features from BigQuery AI like: Generative AI in SQL, Vector Search in SQL, Multimodal Features in SQL, and it can be run as a separate domain system, outside of main EWS system imlementation, or embbeded in the general system architecture, when completed, and has been tested with generated data on a Google Cloud Personal Account, with SQL, and via Kaggle Python scripts.

You can view the project [on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bigquery-ai-hackathon/writeups/climate-early-warning-system-big-data-ai-engine), or read an article about it [on Substack](https://andreibesleaga.substack.com/p/climate-early-warning-system-bigquery).

## Risk Classification

The system automatically classifies locations into risk categories:

- **High Wildfire Risk**: Fire index > 0.7 and temperature > 35Â°C
- **High Flood Risk**: Flood index > 0.7 and precipitation > 80mm
- **Moderate Risks**: Various threshold combinations for temperature, pressure, and precipitation
- **Low Risk**: Normal conditions

## Alert Levels

- **CRITICAL**: Immediate action required (high fire/flood indices)
- **WARNING**: Attention needed (moderate risk conditions)
- **NORMAL**: Standard monitoring

## Technology Stack

- **Google BigQuery**: Data warehouse and analytics platform
- **BigQuery ML**: Machine learning and AI model hosting
- **Gemini AI**: Natural language alert generation
- **Google Cloud Storage**: Satellite imagery storage
- **Google Earth Engine**: Satellite imagery processing and analysis
- **Multimodal Embedding Models**: Image analysis and feature extraction
- **JavaScript**: Earth Engine scripting and automation (Google Earth AI)

## Quick Start

1. **Initialize Database**: Set up BigQuery dataset and run `create.sql` to initialize tables
2. **Generate Test Data**: Use `mock_data_generator.sql` to create large-scale test datasets
3. **Set up Earth Engine**: Follow instructions in `earthAI.md` and use `earthAi.js` for satellite data integration
4. **Create Views**: Deploy optimized views with `views.sql`
5. **Deploy Pipeline**: Set up the decision engine pipeline with `optimized_pipeline.sql`
6. **Validate System**: Run quality checks with `optimized_pipeline_checks.sql`
7. **Enable Alerting**: Deploy alerting logic with `alerting.sql`
8. **Configure Storage**: Set up alert persistence with `alerts_sink.sql`
9. **Integrate Earth AI**: Use `earthAI.sql` to connect satellite imagery processing

(note: you can populate with mock data the tables by modifying and running  `mock_data_generator.sql`)
